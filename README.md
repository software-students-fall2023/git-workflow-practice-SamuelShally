- Interestingly, algorithms we have been unable to improve upon for decades can suddenly be replaced. This aspect of AI is where I am most interested in seeing improvements because if Moore's law truly is dead, it may be able to be replaced with substantial efficiency improvements vis-a-vis algorithms that no human could come up with.

- I find it incredible how AI can now generate better sorting algorithms that took many computer scientists years to develop and create. I think it indeed shows how powerful AI can be that and why it's such a big issue/topic in the field right now. If it can create new algorithms that can run 70% faster than the one we now have, it stands to ask what else AI can do for us.

- It's very cool to see how developers are exploring diverse ways to apply reinforcement learning models to discover and optimize new tools and algorithms. I enjoy reading about the positive real-world impact of AI, rather than articles that solely focus on the doom and gloom aspects of AI.
